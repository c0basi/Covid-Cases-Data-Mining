## Covid-Cases-Data-Mining

Project for the CSI 4142 Class<br >
Project to determine which features cause posititve cases in covid 19

Data is collected from sql tables created in PGAdmin

## Class Imbalance
After the data had been pre processed, a count to see the classes in the training set and test set were done. To see whether the class imbalance plays a role in the classification, the classes were balanced for all 3 models and for each of the 5 sets of features. By doing this a lot of data will be lost but to account for class imbalance, this was the only true way to see whether the imbalance caused misclassifications or not.
